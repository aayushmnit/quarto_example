I love to go on adventures and rescue Princess Peach from the evil Bowser, who always tries to take over the world. I have many friends, such as Yoshi, Toad, and Donkey Kong, who help me along the way. I can jump really high and use power-ups like mushrooms, fire flowers, and stars to gain special abilities. I also enjoy playing sports, racing karts, and partying with my pals. I’m always ready for a challenge and I never give up. That’s why people say I’m super!"
